# cucumber-gatling

This library is a bridge between Cucumber (for Behaviour Driver Development) and Gatling.

Its goal is to use Cucumber to interpret Gherkin files using a custom glue, to generate Gatling scenarios.

This project is a simple proof-of-concept for now, and is not suitable for production-use.
